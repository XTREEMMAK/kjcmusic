  "general_description": "<p>&ldquo;Project Kingdom XIII&rdquo; is a 7 track tribute EP created by Key Jay ahead of the release of Kingdom Hearts 3 utilizing music originally composed by series veterans Yoko Shimomura and Hikaru Utada.</p> <p>The project features brand new takes on familiar tracks including acapella covers, new orchestral renditions, and an explosive original Kingdom Hearts based production featuring exciting new artists.</p> <p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL1Y5Qya2zp98Z7HtE7DXnkjWhzqASBa6o\" width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>",
  "project_involvement": "<p>Above my usual composition and mixing duties, I wore MANY hats for this project; project director, producer, promoter, vocalist, video editor, on-site marketing at conventions, and even web designer (for promotional spots).</p> <p>It is certainly one of my largest projects to date and given the incredible Kingdom Hearts community, very well received! I can&rsquo;t thank them enough!</p> <p>The original idea was to make the project a two part production, however other duties have put further production on this project at a hold for the time being.</p>",
