  "project_involvement": "<p>I contributed a cover to the theme of Oelivert, an ancient dungeon where apparently your magic ability is sealed.</p> <p>Having never played the actual game myself, it was sort of a challenge to get the feel and intent that the song was supposed to portray. In the end, I kept some of the desolate feel while contributing my own ideas to the mix while drawing some inspiration from artists like Tomoya Ohtani, particularly on his use of Eastern instruments.</p> <p>It was an interesting research project in instrumentation; learning how different Eastern instruments are played, and further, performing a realistic as possible performance in a short matter of time.</p> <p>Serving as my first contribution to the Pixel Mixer&rsquo;s, the track serves as a dynamic and breathtaking experience and was definitely an interesting challenge.</p>",
