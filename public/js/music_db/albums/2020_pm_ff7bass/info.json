  "general_description": "<p>&ldquo;Beneath a Stolen Sky&rdquo; is a tribute to Midgar Area tracks from Final Fantasy VII, keeping to the spirit of the Remake. The title is of course inspired by Shinra building the &ldquo;Floating Pizza&rdquo; higher society city above the homes of the lower society people&rsquo;s houses, stealing the sky from them.</p> <p>Originally composed by series veteran Nobuo Uematsu, this album features 23 re-arrangements/remixes from tracks that you can hear in the Midgar area in the original FFVII game + the Remake main theme &ldquo;Hollow&rdquo;. This album involved more than 30 musicians and is the 1st of a compilation of albums that will more or less follow the the releases of the next parts of the Remake, also including the original tracks.</p> <p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZt2oK7IqXs\" width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p> <p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VBtAX1hfuG8\" width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>",
  "project_involvement": "<p>I contributed a cover to &ldquo;Shinra Company&rdquo;, a dynamic theme that shows both the dark nature and implicit power that the Shinra Company has over their citizens in the game.</p> <p>Considering that I composed this remix ahead of the Remake&rsquo;s release and hearing that development would include new clips featuring Shinra propaganda, I decided to run with that idea a bit. The result is an epic rendition featuring 6 voice talents, Cello work by Chromatic Apparatus, and wonderful guitar work by guest Yuki K.</p>",
